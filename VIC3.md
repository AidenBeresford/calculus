## Defining the Derivative

Secant lines can be used to estimate rate of change in a function. 
We can get this secant line by taking two nearby points on a function and drawing a line between them.
To accomplish this, we can use the formula
f(x) - f(a) / x - a, replacing x with a+h (h being a constant approaching zero).
The tangent line of a function at any point a, is the secant line passing through point a.

That function is known as the derivative, and the process of finding it is differentiation.

## Chapter 3, Section 2
## The Derivative as a Function

Using the method from the last section, we can find the derivative at a specific point in x.
If we needed to find the derivative at each point in a domain, we can use the derivative as a function.

A function is differentiable on S if you can differentiate any point in set S.
A function is differentiable at a if you can get a derivative at point a.

To find the derivative of a function, simply:
Substitute the function into your derivative formula
Simplify it
And evaluate the limit.

We can use several different notations to represent the derivative of f(x).
Defining y as equal to f(x), the derivative of f(x) is:
f'(x)
dy/dx
y'
or d/dx * (f(x))
And in place of f'(a), we can use
dy/dx|x=a

A point must be continuous to be differentiable, but a continuous point may not be differentiable.
For example, a function like |x| would be undifferentiable at 0 because it's limit changes depending on the approaching direction.
Another situation would be the cube root of x, where the tangent line at 0 is perfectly vertical.
And there are also numerous weird edge cases where a function can't be differentiable.

Since the derivative of a function is a derivative, we can find the derivative of that derivative.
This is known as a higher order derivative.
