## Chapter 3, Section 1
## Defining the Derivative

Secant lines can be used to estimate rate of change in a function. 
We can get this secant line by taking two nearby points on a function and drawing a line between them.
To accomplish this, we can use the formula
f(x) - f(a) / x - a, replacing x with a+h (h being a constant approaching zero).
The tangent line of a function at any point a, is the secant line passing through point a.

That function is known as the derivative, and the process of finding it is differentiation.
