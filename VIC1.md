## Review of Functions

A function defines the relationship between two sets. The first set containing the input x, and the second set containing the output y.
Functions can be visualized using a graph, where the domain is the input, and the range is the output.
When describing a function for a set with an infinite number of inputs, we can use set builder and interval notations.

Set builder: {x | property}
Interval: (lower bound, upper bound)

Functions can also be composed together. f(x) and g(x) can be composed as f(g(x)) or g(f(x)).
f(g(x)) is defined as f(x) with x being the output of g(x), while g(f(x)) is g(x) with x being the output of f(x).
It's important to note that f(g(x)) and g(f(x)) are not always the same function.
Function composition can be displayed as fog which is f(g(x)).

Functions can be combined through operators as well.
(f+g)(x) is f(x) + g(x)
(f-g)(x) is f(x) - g(x)
(f*g)(x) is f(x) * g(x)
(f/g)(x) is f(x) / g(x) while g(x) != 0

Symmetry in functions is when a function shows symmetry in it's shape when graphed.
For example, if f(x) is equal to f(-x) in all cases, that function is symmetrical across the y-axis.
If f(x) is equal to -f(-x) in all cases, that function is symmetrical across the origin.

## Basic Classes of Functions

Linear functions are functions with the form ax + b, where a and b are constants.
The main distinguishing characteristic of linear functions is that they are graphed as lines.
Linear functions are defined by their slope and y-intercept. The slope is the change in y per change in x.
The y-intercept is the y-value when x is equal to 0.
Linear functions are polynomials, which are functions that can be written in the form a~n~x^n^ + a~n-1~x^n-1^ + ... + a~1~x + a~0~.
Linear functions being in the a~1~x + a~0~ form.
