## Review of Functions

A function defines the relationship between two sets. The first set containing the input x, and the second set containing the output y.
Functions can be visualized using a graph, where the domain is the input, and the range is the output.
When describing a function for a set with an infinite number of inputs, we can use set builder and interval notations.

Set builder: {x | property}
Interval: (lower bound, upper bound)

Functions can also be composed together. f(x) and g(x) can be composed as f(g(x)) or g(f(x)).
f(g(x)) is defined as f(x) with x being the output of g(x), while g(f(x)) is g(x) with x being the output of f(x).
It's important to note that f(g(x)) and g(f(x)) are not always the same function.
Function composition can be displayed as fog which is f(g(x)).

Functions can be combined through operators as well.
(f+g)(x) is f(x) + g(x)
(f-g)(x) is f(x) - g(x)
(f*g)(x) is f(x) * g(x)
(f/g)(x) is f(x) / g(x) while g(x) != 0

Symmetry in functions is when a function shows symmetry in its shape when graphed.
For example, if f(x) is equal to f(-x) in all cases, that function is symmetrical across the y-axis.
If f(x) is equal to -f(-x) in all cases, that function is symmetrical across the origin.

## Basic Classes of Functions

Linear functions are functions with the form ax + b, where a and b are constants.
The main distinguishing characteristic of linear functions is that they are graphed as lines.
Linear functions are defined by their slope and y-intercept. The slope is the change in y per change in x.
The y-intercept is the y-value when x is equal to 0.
Linear functions are polynomials, which are functions that can be written in the form a<sub>n</sub>x<sup>n</sup> + a<sub>n-1</sub>x<sup>n-1</sup> + ... + a<sub>1</sub>x + a<sub>0</sub>.
Linear functions being in the a<sub>1</sub>x + a<sub>0</sub> form. This is called a degree 1 polynomial.

Power functions are functions of the form ax<sup>b</sup> where a and b are real numbers. If b is positive, then the function is polynomial.
If b is even, then the function is considered even and is symmetrical across the y-axis. If b is odd, then the function is considered odd and symmetrical about the origin.

A characteristic of polynomials is the x-intercept, also known as the zero. non-linear polynomials can have multiple zeroes, called roots.
You can find the zero of a linear function by solving mx+b = 0.
You can find the roots of a quadratic (2-degree polynomial) by solving ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0. So on and so forth.

Function transformations are changes to a function, including shifts, scalings, and reflections.
Say our original function is f(x) = x<sup>2</sup>.
f(x) = (x<sup>2</sup> - 2) is a right shift of 2, while f(x) = (x<sup>2</sup>) - 2 is a downwards shift of 2.
f(x) = (2x)<sup>2</sup> is a horizontal scaling of 2, while f(x) = 2(x<sup>2</sup>) is a vertical scaling of 2.
f(x) = (-x)<sup>2</sup> is a reflection over y, while f(x) = -(x<sup>2</sup>) is a reflection over x.

## Trigonometric Functions

Radians are a measurement of angles. We use radians to measure circles. 2pi radians is equal to 360 degrees.

There are 6 basic trigonometric functions, they are as follows:
Sine (sin) which is equal to the opposite side of the angle divided by the hypotenuse.
Cosine (cos) which is equal to the adjacent side of the angle divided by the hypotenuse.
Tangent (tan) which is equal to the opposite side of the angle divided by the adjacent.
Cosecant (csc) which is equal to the hypotenuse divided by the opposite side of the angle.
Secant (sec) which is equal to the hypotenuse divided by the adjacent side of the angle.
Cotangent (cot) which is equal to the adjacent side of the angle divided by the opposite.

Trigonometric identities are rules that are true for all trigonometric functions.
Tangent is equal to sine over cosine, cotangent is equal to cosine over sine.
Cosecant is equal to one over sine, secant is equal to one over cosine.
Sine<sup>2</sup> + cosine<sup>2</sup> is equal to 1.
1 + tangent<sup>2</sup> is equal to secant<sup>2</sup>.
1 + cotangent<sup>2</sup> is equal to cosecant<sup>2</sup>.

Since trigonometric functions correspond to locations on the unit circle, the values repeat. This can be graphed as a wave.
The period of this wave is the distance in x that it takes for the wave to fully repeat.
Sine, cosine, cosecant, and secant functions all have a period of 2pi. Tangent and cotangent have a period of pi.

Function transformations can be applied to trigonometric functions.

## Inverse Functions

Inversing a function is the process of making all the inputs of a function it's outputs, and vice versa. 
A function is only inversible if it still remains a function after inversing, meaning multiple outputs don't share the same input.
If you draw a horizontal line on a graph and it intersects with two points of the same function, it cannot be inversible.
The inverse function of f would be written as f<sup>-1</sup>.

A function like f(x) = x<sup>2</sup> cannot be inverted, but if you restrict the function's domain, you can create an inverse of that restricted function.
The function f(x) = sqrt(x) is an example of a restricted function inversion, being an inversion of f(x) = x<sup>2</sup> restricted to [0, inf).

## Chapter 1, Section 5
## Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

Exponential functions are functions of the form b<sup>x</sup> where b is a constant more than 0 and not 1. 
The b is known as the base, while the x is the exponent.

Logarithmic functions are the inverse of exponential functions.
Logarithmic is a one-to-one inverse of the exponential function.

Hyperbolic functions are functions defined by operations performed on e<sup>x</sup> and e<sup>-x</sup>.
Hyperbolic cosine (cosh) is e<sup>x</sup> + e<sup>-x</sup> / 2
Hyperbolic sine (sinh) is e<sup>x</sup> - e<sup>-x</sup> / 2
Hyperbolic tangent (tanh) is sinh/cosh
Hyperbolic cosecant (csch) is 1/sinh
Hyperbolic secant (sech) is 1/cosh
Hyperbolic cotangent is cosh/sinh

The trigonometric identities can be applied to the hyperbolic functions as well.
